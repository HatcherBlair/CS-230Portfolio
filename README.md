# Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
The Gaming Room is a company with an existing web based game and they were looking to scale up their game for multiple different regions and operating systems so the game had a larger potential user base.  They wanted me to design software that had scalability built in from the ground up and Identify the different software and hardware constraints that would limit their scaling.

# What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
I did a good job of identifying a plan for scaling the game up to millions of concurrent users.  This including things such as making hardware and software recomendations for the backend servers, as well as identifying potential issues when adopting the web based application to different desktop and mobile platforms.

# What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
When you have a design document to start with you are able to begin with a clear idea of what you are going to be doing. When I am developing code without a solid design plan in place I find myself jumping between all the different classes as a realize that I missed something or I need a certain feature for a different class to work properly.  When you start development with a solid design plan in place you are able to focus on one thing at a time without needing to wory about all the other classes working together because they are all already designed to work together, and so it is very easy to segment the design and have multiple people working on the same application at a time.

# If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would revise the UML diagram. The UML diagram in the document was not redone to account for the new scale that we are working on.  I would add sections in the diagram for how the different types of backend servers are going to interact with eachother as well as add new functions for the creation and storage of user data.

# How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
Throughout my engineering education career I learned that often times your client doesn't exactly know what they want.  The client comes to you with a solution in mind and they want that solution.  When this happens it is important to take a step back and look at their needs instead of what they want the final design to look like.  From here you are able to brainstorm different solutions to address these needs and come up with a solution that better fits their problem.  In summary, the users needs are so important because that gives you the constraints that you are working around when designing a solution to their problem.

# How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
I started by analyzing all of the documentation that came along with the software.  I would look at the documentation and then open up the code and read through all of the code and previous coments so that I understood what was happening.  Once I had an understanding of what everything did and how it worked I would then look at the problem that was given to me and figure out how and where to address that problem.  In the future I probably wont be able to read every line of code on a bigger project, and so I would focus more on studying the documentation so that when I get into the code I already know what I am looking at.
